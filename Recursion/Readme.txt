Question 2:

Required file:
Fibonacci.java, main function to drive the code is in the same class.
This contains 
linearFibonacci function for computing fibonacci linearly(O(n) time)
and
logFibonacci function to compute fibonacci number in O(log(n)) time.

We have taken the help of Timer.java to record and compare the running times of the two implementations.
Import the Timer.java file from cs6301.g00 package.

The running times for various inputs are as follows:

Input(n value) linear function's RT(in ms)  log function's RT(in ms)
100                0                             2
500                1                             17
1000               1                             17
5000               4                             224
10000              15                            599                    
50000              62                            6654
100000             281                           20177             
500000             6893                          443462

Note: The fibonacci values for higher n values are not shown in the console of Eclipse but are shown in IntelliJ.
Ideally log function should be taking lesser time when compared to linear function but we have no idea why it is taking longer.
